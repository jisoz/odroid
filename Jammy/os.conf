recovery button  to boot from sd card



Important: For Armbian 23.08 or more recent versions:

Write image to SD using BalenaEtcher.
Boot from SD by holding the recovery (RCI) button while powering the board.
Release RCY button after the blue LED flashes once.
Once booted, use armbian-install to write u-boot to MTD (SPI flash). This completely and irrevocably removes Petitboot, replacing it with mainline u-boot.




sudo armbian-install => install/update the bootloader on MTD fLASH


to connect to wifi put the wifi tp-link adapter and put in armbian odroid 

nmtui-connect 




If you've successfully written the u-boot to the SPI 
flash and configured it to boot from there, it should boot 
without the SD card once the u-boot from SPI flash initiates the boot process.


When the system boots with u-boot located on the SPI flash, the following process typically occurs:

Power On or Reset:

The board is powered on or reset.
Initialization:

The initial boot ROM (read-only memory) code runs, which looks for the bootable devices. It identifies the SPI flash as a bootable source.
Loading u-boot from SPI Flash:

The boot ROM loads the u-boot bootloader from the SPI flash into the memory (RAM).
u-boot Initialization:

Once loaded into memory, u-boot initializes and starts executing its code.
Device Detection and Initialization:

u-boot conducts a series of hardware initialization processes, detecting and configuring essential hardware components like the CPU, memory, peripherals, etc.
Boot Environment Configuration:

u-boot reads its environment variables, including boot parameters, boot device location, kernel image location, and other configuration settings.
Boot Process Execution:

Using the configuration from its environment variables, u-boot executes the boot process. This typically involves loading the kernel image and initializing the operating system.
Operating System Boot:

The kernel image is loaded into memory, initialized, and started, initiating the boot process of the operating system stored on the device (e.g., internal storage, hard drive, or another bootable medium).
Operating System Initialization:

The operating system takes control, initializes drivers, services, and other components, eventually presenting the login prompt or graphical user interface.




If the operating system is not on the SD card after the u-boot is written to the SPI flash, it must be stored on another bootable medium. When you've successfully replaced Petitboot with mainline u-boot on the SPI flash, the operating system could reside in various locations:

Internal Storage: The operating system could be installed on the internal storage of the device, such as an onboard eMMC, SSD, or HDD.

External Storage: It might also reside on an external storage device like a USB drive, SATA drive, or network-attached storage (NAS).

Network Boot: In some configurations, the operating system could be retrieved via a network boot from a server or network storage location.

The key point here is that the u-boot bootloader, once installed on the SPI flash, serves as the initial boot manager. It locates the necessary boot files, such as the kernel and initial RAM disk (initrd), based on the configurations set within u-boot environment variables. These configurations specify the location from which the operating system kernel and related files are loaded.

Therefore, after replacing Petitboot with u-boot on the SPI flash, the operating system needs to be present and accessible from one of these alternative locations for the system to boot successfully without the SD card.
